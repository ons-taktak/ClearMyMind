An online web diary for all things mental health: reminders for appointments with therapists, pill
tracking, journaling, daily challenges/suggestions for healthy activities, and mood tracking. This
will allow users a place to vent, and to manage their lifestyle related to mental health.

## Currently-implemented features:
* Journal entry submission and display
* Prescription creation, display, and expiry alerts
* Pill tracking and display

## How to use:
Because this project is not deployed yet, you need to have a local database (we have used xampp)
We have provided the database.sql file in our repo.
